listen to the sky
let my blade be " "
cut the sky into pieces with my blade

If pieces is 2
cast pieces at 0 into the fire
cast pieces at 1 into the night
say the fire
say the night
While right
let one be the fire
let the fire be one with the night
say the fire
take it to the top

Else
say "I can't work with that"
