I made this so I can put "Rockstar developer" on my resume

## What is this?
There is a programming language called [Rockstar](https://codewithrockstar.com/)
Which was designed for creating programs that are also hair metal power ballads
"Rockstar is intended to give the programmer an unprecedented degree of poetic license when it comes to the composition and structure of their programs"

The program I wrote here takes 2 Integer arguments from standard input and generates a fibonacci sequence and outputs it to standard output

## Why did I make this?
Because I saw that this language was a thing on reddit and I thought it was absolutely hilarious
